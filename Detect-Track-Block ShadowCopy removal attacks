# Detect a Shadow Copy Removal attempts perpetrated by unauthorized attacker

Ransomwares are some of the naties type of virus affecting several companies now a days, when it happens it's probably too late for Blue Team,
let's see if we can prevent one of the biggest flags of an incoming Ransomware Attack to your Organization, by detecting Shadow Copy deletion commands.
We will be using an EDR solution (Endpoint Detection and Response) tool, with a FREE Organization containing two devices, named LimaCharlie.

## Requirements

-A Linux Endpoint or VM: This is our attacker, we will use it to setup a Command and Control type of attack (C2)
-A Windows OS Endpoint or VM: This is our Victim, our guienea pig, we will attack it, and then change hats colors to defend it.
-A Freee Organization in LimaCharlie: You can get up to two sensors for FREE.

## Getting Started

-For this test, we will need to make sure Microsoft Security Defender to be turned OFF. This might be more challenging to do with Windows 11,
but there is a good tool able to silence it permanently if needed.
Enter Sordum's Defender Control:

On a real world scenario, Social Engineering is needed to deceieve a user into running a Script that could launc this tool silently '/s'
and auto disable Windows Defender for us, but for this excersie I will do it manually:
