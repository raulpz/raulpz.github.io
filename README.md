## Detect a Shadow Copy Removal attempts perpetrated by unauthorized attacker

Ransomware is some of the most dangerous type of virus affecting several companies now a days, when it happens it's probably too late for Blue Team,
let's see if we can prevent one of the biggest flags of an incoming Ransomware Attack to your Organization, by detecting Shadow Copy deletion commands.
We will be using an EDR solution (Endpoint Detection and Response) tool, with a FREE Organization containing two devices, named LimaCharlie.

## Requirements

-A Linux Endpoint or VM: This is our attacker, we will use it to setup a Command and Control type of attack (C2)
-A Windows OS Endpoint or VM: This is our Victim, our guienea pig, we will attack it, and then change hats colors to defend it.
-Both devices must be on the same Network.
-A Freee Organization in LimaCharlie: You can get up to two sensors for FREE.

## Getting Started

-For this test, we will need to make sure Microsoft Security Defender to be turned OFF. This might be more challenging to do with Windows 11,
but there is a good tool able to silence it permanently if needed.
Enter Sordum's Defender Control:

On a real world scenario, Social Engineering is needed to deceieve a user into running a Script that could launc this tool silently '/s'
and auto disable Windows Defender for us, but for this excersie I will do it manually:

```
Run As Administrator from Windows Terminal or CMD.

dControl.exe /D  = Disables Windows Defender
dControl.exe /E  = Enabled Windows Defender
```
Result:

-Another useful thing to do, would be to prevent this Windows device from going to sleep, in case we will work on this during a long session.
We will do this, by modifying Windows' Power Plan from Command Prompt as administrator, Run:

```
powercfg /change standby-timeout-ac 0
powercfg /change standby-timeout-dc 0
powercfg /change monitor-timeout-ac 0
powercfg /change monitor-timeout-dc 0
powercfg /change hibernate-timeout-ac 0
powercfg /change hibernate-timeout-dc 0
```
## Installing our first secuirty Tool: Sysmon

-System Monitor (Sysmon) is one of the most commonly used add-ons for Windows logging. With Sysmon, you can detect malicious activity by tracking code behavior and network traffic, as well as create detections based on the malicious activity. We will pull the payload and install it using Powershell:

1- Download the installer payload into C:\Windows\Temp folder:
```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Sysmon.zip -OutFile C:\Windows\Temp\Sysmon.zip
```
2- Unzip the downloaded payload:
```
Expand-Archive -LiteralPath C:\Windows\Temp\Sysmon.zip -DestinationPath C:\Windows\Temp\Sysmon
```
3- Let's get a custom set of options for SysMon, Download SwiftOnSecurityâ€™s Sysmon config file:
```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml -OutFile C:\Windows\Temp\Sysmon\sysmonconfig.xml
```
4- Install Sysmon and apply it's config file. (this file configures Sysmon for us, to keep an eye on Security Related data).
```
C:\Windows\Temp\Sysmon\Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i
```
```
C:\Windows\Temp\Sysmon\sysmonconfig.xml
```
Let's Verify Sysmon is up and running:
```
Get-Service sysmon64
```

## Installing our EDR agent (this is where the show beings)
A LimaCharlie account is needed, with one Organization created, you may create one with whatever name you want.
